# Bitlayer Brand Kit
Our brand kit has been meticulously designed to ensure consistency and recognizability across all platforms and mediums. It includes high-resolution logos, official color palettes, typography, and usage guidelines that represent the essence of our brand.

Before you download or use any of the assets, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines to ensure our brand remains consistent and is portrayed in the best possible light:

**Do not alter the logos:** This includes changing colors, dimensions, or adding your own design elements.

**Follow the spacing guidelines:** Ensure our logo has enough space to stand out without interference from other elements.

**Use the official colors:** Stick to the color palettes provided for any backgrounds or design elements that accompany our logo.

**Typography matters:** Only use the approved typefaces included in the brand kit to maintain a unified brand voice.

**Respect the context:** Our logo should not be associated with any content that doesn't align with our brand values.

Thank you for your commitment to upholding the Bitlayer brand.
